## Repositorie
For the duration of this semester i will complete all five projects using one repositary.Testing each project using development branches before pushing the final updated version. By doing so I will use a basic folder structure to seperate the diffrent projects from each other
## Diagram of how repositorie and projects are integrated

## Branching strategy to be used:
I will be using a simple branching strategy throughout the course of this semester. Using a simple branching strategy requires me to make feuture branches were i wil update my project and test al bug fixes before aplying the to main branch. Release branches will not be part of my strategy due to all bugs that needs to be fixed before the submission of projects, therefor i wil use the idea of the realease branches during testing then merging back to main branch for submission.
## How I will implement the .gitignore files
All projects are idividuel projects wmeaning all files will only be used by myself, therefor allowing me to ignore any files that are not currently in use by a project.This will avoid costly commits to files that shouldnt be versioned.

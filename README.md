## Repository
For the duration of this semester, I will complete all five projects using one repository. Testing each project using development branches before pushing the final updated version. By doing so I will use a basic folder structure to separate the different projects from each other

## Branching strategy to be used:
I will be using a simple branching strategy throughout the course of this semester. Using a simple branching strategy requires me to make future branches where I will update my project and test al bug fixes before applying them to main branch. Release branches will not be part of my strategy due to all bugs that needs to be fixed before the submission of projects, therefor I will use the idea of the release branches during testing then merging back to main branch for submission.
## How I will implement the .gitignore files
All projects are individual projects meaning all files will only be used by myself, therefor allowing me to ignore any files that are not currently in use by a project. This will avoid costly commits to files that shouldnâ€™t be versioned. Some security files will also be ignored in order to keep sensitive information and credentials safe.
## Security
In the remainder of this semester, I will be using secrets as the main source to keep sensitive information and credentials. By doing so only collaborators will be able to have access to these secrets. In some cases, a security file will be created and ignored as second way of keeping information safe.

# Project1
## Repository
For the duration of this semester, I will complete all five projects using one repository. Testing each project using development branches before pushing the final updated version. By doing so I will use a basic folder structure to separate the different projects from each other
## Diagram of how repository and projects are integrated

## Branching strategy to be used:
I will be using a simple branching strategy throughout the course of this semester. Using a simple branching strategy requires me to make future branches where I will update my project and test al bug fixes before applying them to main branch. Release branches will not be part of my strategy due to all bugs that needs to be fixed before the submission of projects, therefor I will use the idea of the release branches during testing then merging back to main branch for submission.
## How I will implement the .gitignore files
All projects are individual projects meaning all files will only be used by myself, therefor allowing me to ignore any files that are not currently in use by a project. This will avoid costly commits to files that shouldnâ€™t be versioned. Some security files will also be ignored in order to keep sensitive information and credentials safe.
## Security
In the remainder of this semester, I will be using secrets as the main source to keep sensitive information and credentials. By doing so only collaborators will be able to have access to these secrets. In some cases, a Security.md file will be created and ignored as second way of keeping information safe.
# Project2
## Api and user information
Project2 is all about api. In this project we created diffrent types of api methods like get,delete,put and post which all have diffrent tasks they perform.
Api's can be used more than just data retreval but as well as building programs.
In this program users should be autherized before being able to have access to api methods. Once Authorized users can manipulate database through the use of the diffrent api methods.
## Azure
Azure was used in this project to Host our database and our api. Access to resource group was granted to moderaters 
## Github
Source control was used as continuation of project1, to keep up 2 date with all our cmpg 323 work.
##Authorization
Our Database can only be accessed if users has the Database username and passsword.
All api endpoints also got their own authorization in order to use the api's. A token based Authorization was used at all endpoints.
